# NYC Rat Inspection Data

## Project Context

The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) collects and publishes data on 311 calls for rat inspections throughout the city. The public is encouraged to explore the open-source data to gain insights into rat inspection patterns. Python was used to conduct an exploratory analysis and merge inspection data with open-source property value data from the New York City Department of Finance.

## Key Questions

- Which boroughs have the most inspections?
- What kind of inspection/call is the most common overall?
- Is there a correlation between the number of inspections in a borough and its median property value?
- When were the most inspections conducted? The least inspections?
- How do 2023â€™s inspection numbers compare to pre-pandemic number of inspections?


## Data

The rat inspection data set came from the open-source [NYC Rodent Inspection Data Set](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Rodent-Inspection/p937-wjvj/about_data). Property value data came from the open-source [NYC Condominium Comparable Rental Income Data Set](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/DOF-Condominium-Comparable-Rental-Income-in-NYC/9ck6-2jew/about_data). A geojson file of New York City boroughs for dashboarding was accessed [here on Github](https://github.com/codeforgermany/click_that_hood/blob/main/public/data/new-york-city-boroughs.geojson).

## Folders

The project files are divided between the following folders:

- Project Management: Project brief
- Data: Data dictionaries, merged data sets, and subsets of cleaned rat inspection data
- Scripts: Jupyter notebooks containing code for analysis
- Analysis: Visualizations used for insights. Note: Tableau storyboard does not contain every step taken as part of the analysis, only those relevant to the final results.
